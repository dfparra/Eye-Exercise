# Eye Exercise

## Project Description
This JavaScript project uses the Mouse event mousemove to bind with the DOM element of an eyeball to move the mouse.
When the user moves the mouse across the screen, the pupil of the eyeball will follow the mouse movement

### How to Run
Load the HTML page and move the mouse across the screen.

### Roadmap of future improvements
Add a user interface that allows the user to decide how many eyes to add to the screen.
Add buttons to add and remove the eyes on the screen.
